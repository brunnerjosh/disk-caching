/*
 * PURPOSE OF FILE
 * This file's purpose serves to implement disk caching baseed upon the approach 
 * of using a Second Chance Algorithm (SCA). While the SCA is described in great
 * detail above the function theVictim(), I'll briefly describe it here. 
 * Bascially, it loops over all data in cache and looks for a victim. If no 
 * victim is found, it loops again to the last referenced block and chooses it.
 *
 * BRIEF NOTE
 * Throughout this program, you'll notice many functions use other functions to
 * accomplish some sort of work. The purpose behind this was to dramatically 
 * shorten the amount of repetitive code throughout similar (yet different 
 * functions). If you're unclear of a certain function's purpose, scroll down 
 * to that function and read the description above it.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 * 1. It is assumed that the user is running this file in ThreadOS's directory.

     * (meaning it hasn't been recently used), return this as the victim. If the
     * reference bit is set (the block has been recently used), move onto the 
     * next block in a circular fashion. However, before leaving that last 
     * block, mark its reference bit to false (hasn't been recently used), 
     * effectively giving the block a second chance.
